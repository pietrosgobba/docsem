The PhD Seminar is an important part of the research training offered at the [Mathematics Research Unit](http://math.uni.lu){:target="_blank"} of the [University of Luxembourg](http://www.uni.lu/){:target="_blank"}. This website summarises past and upcoming sessions, in a new design starting from November 2019, by <a href="http://http://robert.tractatus.info">Robert Baumgarth</a> and was last updated on {{ 'now' | date: "%d %B %Y" }}. It also features the &laquo;&nbsp;PhD Away Days&nbsp;&raquo;, i.e. a weekend during which the PhD candidates present their research area or related topics to their fellow PhD students hence strengthening their presentation skills and socialise with the other PhD candidates.

Its now migrated Jekyll based theme and its sources can be found on
