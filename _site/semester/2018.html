                    <span class="abstract-span"><b>Abstract</b></span> Recently, many cryptographers have put a lot of research in multilinear maps for cryptography. These are a generalization of bilinear maps, also known as bilinear pairings, and which have already been proved to have many applications in cryptography, as for instance a secure key exchange between three people, known as the 3-partite one-round Diffie-Hellman key exchange by Antoine Joux, 2000, a direct generalization of the classical Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. Roughly speaking, by key exchange protocol, we mean that two (or more?) people want to share a common message (a key) by communicating over an insecure channel. The goals of this talk are first to first define such multilinear maps; second to study some elliptic curve arithmetic and bilinear pairings (especially, the Weil pairing) on elliptic curves, in order to, third, understand the key exchange protocol on elliptic curves by Joux. To conclude, a direct application of multilinear maps in order to generalize these results.

                    <span class="abstract-span"><b>Abstract</b></span> At the end of the 18th century, Ernst Chladni, a physicist and musician, made an interesting discovery: he observed that when he excited a metal plate with the bow of his violin, he could hear sounds of different frequency. The plate was fixed only at its center, and when Chladni put some sand on it, then for each frequency a curious pattern appeared, today known as Chladni figures. Some time later, Kirchhoff pointed out that these patterns correspond to nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the biharmonic operator. In this talk, we introduce random Laplacian eigenfunctions on the three-dimensional torus, known as arithmetic random waves. More precisely, we prove a limit theorem for the nodal surface of arithmetic random waves as the eigenvalue goes to infinity.

(Jill Marie-Anne ECKER, May 17) The introductory part contains an historical overview on divergent series. This includes the treatment of divergent series by mathematicians of the 18 th century, such as Euler, Leibniz or Bernoulli. Moreover, we will show the importance of divergent series in modern physics such as quantum field theory and string theory.

(Thi Hanh VO, May 31) The second part includes several summation methods of divergent series. The definitions of the summation methods are accompanied by a plethora of examples of summations of famous divergent series. Several theorems allow to compare the strength of the various summation methods. Furthermore, we will present regularization via the analytical continuation of the zeta function, with a particular focus on the derivation of the result 1+2+3+...=-1/12. We conclude by giving other values of the zeta-function in terms of the Bernoulli numbers.

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    The PhD seminar is replaced once per year by the &laquo;&nbsp;PhD Away Days&nbsp;&raquo;, i.e. a weekend
    during which the PhD candidates present their research area or related topics to their fellow PhD students
    hence strengthening their presentation skills and socialise with the other PhD candidates. How to organise 
    the mathematical content (GMS style talks, mini courses etc.) and the journey and corresponding activities 
    varies depending on the organising PhD representative(s).

    
    <h3>Dates and Location</h3>
    The PhD Away Days 2018 took place in <b>Heidelberg, Germany from May 24 to
            May 27, 2018</b>.
    The presentations were assessed by  Andrew BRUCE and Shaunak DEO and James THOMPSON.
