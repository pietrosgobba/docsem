In this talk, I will begin with Thomas Royenâ€™s simple proof of the long-standing Gaussian correlation conjecture, which lies in the intersection of convex geometry and probability. If time permits, I will mention another conjecture in the Gaussian world, the Gaussian (moment) product conjecture, and some recent progress.
