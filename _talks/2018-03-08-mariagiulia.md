In this talk, I will talk about congruent numbers. After giving their definition and a brief historical introduction, I will explain various formulation of the problem. At the end, I will explain the correlation between the congruent numbers problem and the weak Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture on elliptic curves.
