Symmetric _n_-ary bands are _n_-ary semigroups _(X,F)_ such that _F_ is invariant under the action of permutations and idempotent, i.e., satisfies _F(x,...,x) = x_ for all _x âˆˆ X_. We provide a constructive description of the class of symmetric _n_-ary bands. In particular, we introduce the concept of strong _n_-ary semilattice of _n_-ary semigroups and we show that the symmetric _n_-ary bands are exactly the strong _n_-ary semilattices of _n_-ary extensions of Abelian groups whose exponents divide _n-1_.
