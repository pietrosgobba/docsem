The aim of this talk will be to give an introduction of the concept of complex projective structures on surfaces and to describe a parametrization result of them. We will firstly give the necessary definitions and we will describe how to build the developing map and the holonomy representation of such a structure. Finally, we will discuss the connection between these objects and the data of a Riemann surface structure and a holomorphic quadratic differential on it.
