After discussing the L-functions in the ad hoc fashion we will introduce the Local zeta integrals in which we will state the multiplicity one theorem in the form of distribution of a space of Schwartz-Bruhat functions on a given number field. Finally, the main result of Tate's thesis on the Global zeta integrals will get a treatment.
