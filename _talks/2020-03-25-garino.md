A fundamental topic in contemporary probability and statistics is to quantify the efficiency of asymptotic estimator by providing a wide variety of central limit-type theorems.
I will more specifically present some recent results on stochastic integrals driven by Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion. After introducing properly the notions mentioned above, I will state and prove a central limit theorem for the Euler-Maruyama type approximation.
