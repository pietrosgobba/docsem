title:      "Parametrized complexity of bin-packing"
speaker:    Alisa GOVZMANN
categories: talks

I will first introduce and explain one of the seven famous millennium problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute and known as the P vs. NP problem. Then I will analyze the bin-packing problem, which is known to be NP-complete and hence might be used in order to solve the P vs. NP problem. I will introduce a runtime analysis method known as parametrized complexity and show a nice  parametrized algorithm for bin-packing.
