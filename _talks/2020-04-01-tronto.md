In my research I study the arithmetic properties of algebraic groups, 
which are algebraic varieties with a group structure. In this talk I 
will give a definition of algebraic group and I will then explain how 
the "functor of points" can give us a way of seeing these objects that 
does not rely on algebraic geometry. In the second part we will se what 
kind of field extensions arise from the points of an algebraic group.
