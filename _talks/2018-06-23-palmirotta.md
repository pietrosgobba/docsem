The Malgrange-Ehrenpreis Theorem states that every non-zero linear partial differential operator with constant coefficients in R^n has a fundamental solution. This theorem was a first evidence of the impact of distribution theory in its application to linear partial differential equations and, therefore, there were found several different proofs of it in subsequent years. The aim of this talk is to shortly survey the different proofs and to focus on the classical proof of Ehrenpreis and Malgrange by giving some illustra
